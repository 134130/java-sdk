# Dependency Management

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

The Bill of Materials (BOM) declares the recommended versions of all the dependencies used by a given release.
Using the BOM from your application's build script avoids the need for you to specify and maintain the dependency versions yourself.
Instead, the version of the BOM you're using determines the utilized dependency versions.
It also ensures that you're using supported and tested versions of the dependencies by default, unless you choose to override them.

Add the BOM to your project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Maven">
```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.modelcontextprotocol.sdk</groupId>
            <artifactId>mcp-bom</artifactId>
            <version>0.6.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Gradle">
```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation platform("org.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-bom:0.6.0-SNAPSHOT")
  //...
}
```

Gradle users can also use the Spring AI MCP BOM by leveraging Gradle (5.0+) native support for declaring dependency constraints using a Maven BOM.
This is implemented by adding a 'platform' dependency handler method to the dependencies section of your Gradle build script.
As shown in the snippet below this can then be followed by version-less declarations of the Starter Dependencies for the one or more spring-ai modules you wish to use, e.g. spring-ai-openai.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Replace the version number with the version of the BOM you want to use.

## Available Dependencies

The following dependencies are available and managed by the BOM:

### Core Dependencies

- `org.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp` - Core MCP library providing the base functionality and APIs for Model Context Protocol implementation.

### Transport Dependencies

- `org.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-spring-webflux` - WebFlux-based Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport implementation for reactive applications.
- `org.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-spring-webmvc` - WebMVC-based Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport implementation for servlet-based applications.

### Testing Dependencies

- `org.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-test` - Testing utilities and support for MCP-based applications.
